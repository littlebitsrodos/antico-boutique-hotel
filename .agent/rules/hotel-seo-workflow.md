# Hotel SEO Workflow

1. **Title Hierarchy**: Every page must have exactly one `<h1>`.
2. **Meta Descriptions**: Must be between 120-160 characters and include "Rhodes" and "Boutique Hotel".
3. **Image Alt Text**: All images must have descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.
4. **Structured Data**: Every page should include relevant Schema.org JSON-LD (e.g., Hotel, Room, or LocalBusiness).
5. **Canonical Tags**: Maintain absolute URLs in canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues.
6. **Performance**: Large images must be optimized to WebP format before deployment.
