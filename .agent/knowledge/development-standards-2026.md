# 2026 Web Development Standards

This document outlines the core technical and strategic standards required for the Palazzo Antico project, based on the 2026 industry landscape.

## 1. Essential Technical Foundations
- **Semantic HTML**: Mandatory for SEO and accessibility.
- **Modern CSS**: Mastery of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and HSL color systems. (Vanilla CSS preferred for this project's bespoke aesthetic).
- **TypeScript/ES6+**: Standard for safe, collaborative logic.

## 2. Modern Design & Strategy
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1/2.2)**: Every component must be navigable by keyboard and screen readers.
- **Core Web Vitals**: Speed and stability are top priorities. Abandonment happens after <3 seconds.
- **Mobile-First**: Design and functionality must adapt perfectly to smartphones.
- **AI Collaboration**: Leveraging agentic workflows (Antigravity) for rapid prototyping and personalization.

## 3. Professional Workflow
- **Git/GitHub**: Strict version control and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- **Security**: SSL/HTTPS, secure headers, and following OWASP standards.
- **Performance Linting**: Automated testing via Lighthouse and custom scripts.
